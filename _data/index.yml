        **Welcome**
      text: |
        Fr Collins Okafor welcomes you to a contemporary Catholic experience
        each Saturday and Sunday, as well as to masses scheduled on weekdays.
        Everyone is welcome in our community, in the spirit of worship,
        service, and evangelization.

        The mission of our parish is to seek *Christ* in all things and to give
        glory to *God*. Our faith-filled community, under the inspiration and
        guidance of the *Holy&nbsp;Spirit*, strives to offer nourishment as a
        joyful family gathered around the Eucharist.

        The centre of our parish is St&nbsp;James the&nbsp;Great Church,
        [located in MacTier,&nbsp;Ontario](https://goo.gl/maps/UH2kHye9WgG2),
        in the heart of Georgan Bay region.
        This more-than-100-year-old church has stood as a pillar in the
        community, not only for our Catholic family but also the community at
        large.

        St James serves our area throughout the year, with Sunday mass held
        each weekend, along with weekday masses on select days.
        Please see mass schedule in the Bulletin.

        Mission
      text: |
        Built on Whiteside Road/Fenne's Point by the shoreline of beautiful
        Lake Muskoka, St&nbsp;Anne&apos;s is a Mission Church within our
        parish,
        [located outside Bala and Port Carling,&nbsp;Ontario](https://goo.gl/maps/ARRuSdhUYqu).
        This small, quaint church nestled in the woods stands not only as a
        reminder to our Christian heritage, but of the timelessness of
        God&apos;s presence even in our contemporary lives.

        Mass is celebrated year-round.
        Please see mass schedule in the Bulletin.
