    **St James the Great** in MacTier,
    together with our sister church
    **St&nbsp;Anne&apos;s&nbsp;Mission** in Bala,
    form a welcoming Roman&nbsp;Catholic parish dedicated to the
    spiritual, emotional, and physical needs of its
    members&nbsp;and&nbsp;community.

    Through worship, education, and service, this faith-filled community,
    under the inspiration and guidance of the *Holy&nbsp;Spirit*,
    strives to be nourished as a joyful family gathered around
    the&nbsp;Eucharist. **Everyone&nbsp;is&nbsp;welcome.**
